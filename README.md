# myQuiz 🧠

> A modern, intelligent flashcard application built for efficient learning.

myQuiz is a full-stack web application designed to help you master new subjects through customizable flashcard collections. Whether you're learning a new language or preparing for an exam, myQuiz offers a smart study environment with progress tracking and prioritization.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📂 Collection Management**: Create, edit, and organize your flashcards into custom collections.
- **⚡ Smart Study Mode**: A dedicated study interface that prioritizes cards based on your needs (see "Under the Hood").
- **🌍 Public & Private Access**: Keep your collections private or explore public collections shared by others.
- **🔍 Global Search**: Find existing flashcards from the global database and add them to your own collections.
- **✅ Progress Tracking**: Mark cards as "Learned" effectively removing them from the immediate study queue.
- **🚀 Priority System**: Assign priority levels (1-5) to specific cards to control how often they appear during study sessions.

##  ⚙️ Under the Hood: What makes it cool?

The most interesting part of `myQuiz` is the **Study Session Algorithm** located in `CardView.jsx`. It's not just a random shuffler; it's designed to reinforce difficult concepts.

### 1. Weighted Priority Queue
When you start a study session, the app doesn't just grab your cards. It builds a **weighted queue** based on the priority you assigned (1-5):
- A card with **Priority 1** is added to the pool once.
- A card with **Priority 5** is added **five times**.
This means difficult or high-importance cards appear more frequently within a single session, reinforcing the memory trace through repetition.

### 2. Intelligent Filtering
The algorithm automatically filters out cards you have already marked as `isLearned`. This ensures your study time is efficient, focusing strictly on active recall of unknown material.

### 3. Fisher-Yates Shuffle
Once the weighted pool is generated, a custom implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle ensures a truly random distribution of the cards, preventing any predictable patterns during your study session.
